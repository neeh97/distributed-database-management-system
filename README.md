# distributed-database-management-system
This project was done by a 3-man team as part of the coursework. It is a distributed database console application written in Java that can parse standard SQL CRUD operations and performs actions upon the data stored in different locations. 
To simulate different locations, a copy of the application was hosted on a virtual machine in Google cloud which had a part of the data.
